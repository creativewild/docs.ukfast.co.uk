If you copy the headers into your own spreadsheet you can then input your own data. Note: The headers must not have spaces in between words and the company field doesn’t have to be filled in. The password field can also be left blank if preferred and a password will be automatically chosen.

Click ‘Choose File’ then upload your Excel file. Once uploaded you should see a screen like the one below.

You can then set basic user permissions and admin privileges as described in the previous section on Adding Employees manually.
