# Drive Mapper

If you won’t want to login to the FASTdrive web application each time you wish to access your files and folders, there are a number of “power tools” available from the FASTdrive control panel to fully integrate your device with FASTdrive.  If you use Windows, we recommend you use ShareFile Drive Mapper, which you can download by browsing to “Apps” from within the FASTdrive web application and selecting “Drive Mapper”.  Alternatively you will find the download link below:

Once you downloaded ShareFile Drive Mapper you will need to follow the download wizard carefully, if you have any issues with downloading and or installing, please do not hesitate to call the FASTdrive support line. Our support line numbers can be found on our website: www.ukfast.co.uk

When the installation is complete you will now be presented with a login screen shown below.

The email and password are the same as you use to login to the FASTdrive unique web application
You will now be logged in and will have access to all the files and folders which you have permission to access on FASTdrive.
Drive Mapper automatically maps your FASTdrive account and appears as a drive (the S: drive by default) in your Windows Explorer.  You can then browse through your files and folders like you would if you were browsing any other folder.
