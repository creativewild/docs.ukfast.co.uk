This will begin the download process which will vary depending on your browser, but you will always find the file in your downloads folder. Chrome users will see a tab at the bottom of the window which will  be the file you downloaded, you can click this to open and view the file. Firefox users will see an arrow icon near the top right corner of the screen; click on this to find your file. 
When using ShareFile Drive Mapper, you will not need to download files, they will be available for you to access directly so long as you have a connection to the internet. If you do want to have a hard copy on your PC, you just need to copy and paste the file out of the S drive into your local Drive.
