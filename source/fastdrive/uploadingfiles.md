#Uploading Files

You will be presented with “My Files & Folders”. From here you can drag and drop the file you would like to upload, or alternatively click the Upload files button which allows you to browse to files you want to upload.

If you are using ShareFile Drive Mapper to upload all you need to do is drag the file into the folder you want it to go into and it will update and make it available for other users who have access to that folder
