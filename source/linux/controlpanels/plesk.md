# Plesk

## Connecting

If Plesk is installed on your server then it can be accessed at the following location:

```console
  https://ip.ip.ip.ip:8443
```

```eval_rst
.. note::
   The first time you access this, it will likely show a certificate warning that varies depending on which browser you're using.

   This is nothing to be worried about, it's just that plesk uses a self-signed certificate to encrypt traffic.
```

Once you've skipped the warning, you'll be at the Plesk login page. Later versions of Plesk will accept the root credentials for the server, but the traditional way is the use the `admin` username and the Plesk password provided by UKFast on server launch.

## Further Documentation

Describing individual Plesk issues is typically beyond the scope of a page such as this due to the constant changes brought to Plesk.
