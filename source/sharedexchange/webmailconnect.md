# Connecting via Webmail

The outlook web access (webmail) page for our shared exchange infrastructure can be found here:

.. note::
   As we're working with a Microsoft product here, the webmail will be much more functional if you use Internet Explorer.

   Other browsers will likely work fine, but you'll get a cutdown version.
```

Using the webmail client can be a great diagnostic tool. If you're having trouble connecting in one of the other ways, we'll often ask you to first log in over webmail to see if it's a simple credential issue.
