#Adding Employees

Employees can be easily added by the administrator. In order to add employee users it’s important to take note how many user licenses are available. If you have reached the maximum amount of licenses available then contact your UKFast account manager to purchase more.

Multiple employees can be added at once by uploading an Excel spreadsheet which contains their names. On the ‘Manage Users Home’ tab, there is a button that says ‘Create Employee’

From here you can either go through the manual steps of adding an employee, or you can add multiple employees from an Excel spreadsheet.
