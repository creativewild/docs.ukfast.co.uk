# Where can I see my bandwidth usage?

You can see bandwidth graphs for most of your devices that you have with UKFast. The exception to this at the moment is with Virtual servers in both eCloud and eCloud Flex.


To begin, you must first login to your [MyUKFast area](https://www.ukfast.co.uk/myukfast.html) and access the Dedicated Servers link via the `Products and Services` menu, which is located across the top of the page.


Within this section you will be presented with a list of devices available to you. You can search and browse through these, clicking on the IP or Name to take you to the specific device.


You will now see some further tabs to navigate the device, you can click on either Traffic or PPS (packets per second) to view the relevant graphs.


## Traffic
These graphs will show you the traffic that has been sent and received for this device over varying periods of time.
